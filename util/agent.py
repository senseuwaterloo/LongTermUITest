            "1. Limit your output to a maximum of 5 suggestions. It's okay to provide fewer if appropriate.\n"
            "2. Terminate your answer immediately after listing all suggestions. Do not add any concluding remarks.\n"

            "4. If an element locator is the issue and the element appears in the provided HTML list, propose a robust new locator using that information.\n"
            "5. Keep your descriptions brief. Focus on the code.\n"
            "6. The `find_element` and `click` methods in this framework already have built-in dynamic waits and exception handling. Do not suggest adding explicit waits unless truly necessary for a specific condition not covered by the framework's defaults.\n"
            "7. Ensure the 'Original code line/lines' and 'Fixed code line/lines' are precise, complete, and maintain correct Python syntax and indentation relative to their position within a method.\n"
            "8. The 'Fixed code line/lines' should be a direct replacement for 'Original code line/lines'. If adding new lines, include them in the 'Fixed code line/lines' and adjust 'Original code line/lines' to represent the line(s) being replaced or the line before which new code is inserted (if no lines are replaced).\n"
            "9. If the fix involves changing a configuration or an import, clearly state this in the description and provide the code change as if it were part of the method for context, or specify where the change should be made if outside the method (e.g., 'Update configuration file X with Y'). However, prioritize in-method code fixes.\n"
