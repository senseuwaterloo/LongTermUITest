Just answer a few questions regarding the model and condition, and we will provide an estimated trade-in value◊◊ or a simple way to recycle it for free if it’s not eligible for credit.\nIf your iPad is eligible and you accept the quote, we will send you a free trade-in kit, separate to your new iPad (at no cost to you) so you can then send in your current iPad within the 14-day return window. Once we receive your iPad, we’ll inspect it and verify its condition. If the condition matches what you described, there’s nothing more you need to do. If the condition doesn’t match, a new trade-in value will be provided. You’ll have the option to either accept this revised value or reject it. We’ll work with you to confirm that you still want to move forward with the trade‑in.\nIf you buy online and choose to pay with Apple Card Monthly Installments, we’ll instantly apply your estimated trade‑in value to the purchase of your new iPad. If you pay in full, your trade-in value is applied as a refund to your original payment method. This happens once we receive your eligible iPad and confirm that the condition matches what you described.\nThe trade-in process can take up to 2-3 weeks.\nYou can also trade in your device at an Apple Store at the point of purchase, however the trade-in value in store may be different from the estimated trade-in value you received online."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is included with AppleCare+?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Your new iPad comes with one year of hardware repair coverage and up to 90 days of technical support.

                                                    <p>The Apple Trade In program makes it easy to trade in an eligible iPad. Just answer a few questions regarding the model and condition, and we will provide an estimated trade-in value◊◊ or a simple way to recycle it for free if it’s not eligible for credit.</p>
<p>If your iPad is eligible and you accept the quote, we will send you a free trade-in kit, separate to your new iPad (at no cost to you) so you can then send in your current iPad within the 14-day return window. </p>
<p>Once we receive your iPad, we’ll inspect it and verify its condition. If the condition matches what you described, there’s nothing more you need to do. If the condition doesn’t match, a new trade-in value will be provided. You’ll have the option to either accept this revised value or reject it. We’ll work with you to confirm that you still want to move forward with the trade‑in.</p>
<p>If you buy online and choose to pay with Apple Card Monthly Installments, we’ll instantly apply your estimated trade‑in value to the purchase of your new iPad. If you pay in full, your trade-in value is applied as a refund to your original payment method. This happens once we receive your eligible iPad and confirm that the condition matches what you described.</p>
<p>The trade-in process can take up to 2-3 weeks.</p>
<p>You can also trade in your device at an Apple Store at the point of purchase, however the trade-in value in store may be different from the estimated trade-in value you received online.</p>

<p>If your iPad is eligible and you accept the quote, we will send you a free trade-in kit, separate to your new iPad (at no cost to you) so you can then send in your current iPad within the 14-day return window. </p>
<p>Once we receive your iPad, we’ll inspect it and verify its condition. If the condition matches what you described, there’s nothing more you need to do. If the condition doesn’t match, a new trade-in value will be provided. You’ll have the option to either accept this revised value or reject it. We’ll work with you to confirm that you still want to move forward with the trade‑in.</p>
<p>If you buy online and choose to pay with Apple Card Monthly Installments, we’ll instantly apply your estimated trade‑in value to the purchase of your new iPad. If you pay in full, your trade-in value is applied as a refund to your original payment method. This happens once we receive your eligible iPad and confirm that the condition matches what you described.</p>
<p>The trade-in process can take up to 2-3 weeks.</p>
